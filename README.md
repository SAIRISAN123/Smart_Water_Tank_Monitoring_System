The Smart Water Tank IoT project introduces an innovative system designed to 
revolutionize the monitoring and management of water storage. With the growing 
concern over water scarcity and resource management, this project aims to address 
these challenges by implementing an Internet of Things (IoT) framework.
The system integrates sensor technology and IoT principles to enable real-time 
monitoring of water levels, temperature, and usage within storage tanks. Utilizing 
ultrasonic sensors, the system accurately measures water levels, DS18B20 
temperature sensor, the system accurately measures water temperature and 
transmits those data to a centralized platform via wireless communication 
protocols such as Wi-Fi & MQTT.
Through a user-friendly interface, users can access comprehensive data analytics, 
including consumption patterns, leak detection, and predictive maintenance 
insights. The platform provides actionable information to optimize water usage, 
prevent wastage, and streamline operational efficiency.
This project represents a critical step towards sustainable water management, 
offering a scalable, cost-effective solution to monitor and conserve water resources 
effectively
